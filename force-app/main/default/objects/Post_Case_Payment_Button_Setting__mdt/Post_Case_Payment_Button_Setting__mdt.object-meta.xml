    <description>The PostCasePaymentController apex class references this matrix to determine if the Save Recommend Allocation, Post Payment, or Post with PRs buttons should be visible and active.

The code really only checks for an &quot;Active&quot; value in the 3 button rendering fields, though it could be extended to include &quot;Inactive&quot; which could display the button greyed out, once the controller code and VFP has been updated to do so.

At least one of the DIR Case Recordtype Name, User Profile and Permission Set fields must be filled. Leaving either or both of the other 2 null will indicate a wildcard for that field--except leaving all 3 null will result in an MDT that never gets used by the code.

The Condition Field and Condition Field Value fields are not used at this time (22 Dec 2019)</description>
